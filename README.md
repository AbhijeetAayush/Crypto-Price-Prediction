# Crypto Price predictor
CryptoLSTMPricePredictor is a deep learning project aimed at predicting the prices of cryptocurrencies using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for time series prediction tasks. This project harnesses the power of LSTM networks to analyze historical cryptocurrency price data and make predictions about future price movements.
